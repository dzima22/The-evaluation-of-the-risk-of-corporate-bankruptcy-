# :bulb: About
The study focuses on the prediction of company bankruptcies using econometric techniques, specifically analyzing the financial data of Polish companies from 2008 to 2020. The goal is to evaluate the accuracy of logistic regression models in assessing the risk of bankruptcy.

# :test_tube: Methodology
- The study utilizes financial data of Polish companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) and NewConnect from 2008 to 2020. The data includes both bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies, categorized based on specific financial criteria. The dataset comprises financial statements and key financial ratios such as Return on Assets (ROA), Debt Ratio (OZ), Current Ratio (BP), Debt Service Coverage Ratio (WOZ), and Total Asset Efficiency Ratio (WO). üîç
- The sample is divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to build and calibrate the logistic regression models, while the test set is used to validate the model's predictive accuracy.

-ROC Curve and AUC: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted to visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for different threshold values
-Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated to quantify the overall ability of the model to discriminate between the classes. So in this research auc=0,94 so the predictive properties can be assessed as good, but it should be remembered that the study was conducted on a relatively small sample.

The confusion matrix in Table 3.4 illustrates the performance of the logistic regression model on the test dataset. The matrix provides a comprehensive summary of the classification results, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
